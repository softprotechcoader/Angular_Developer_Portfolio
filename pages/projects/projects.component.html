      <h4>Revenue Forecast Portal – Cognizant: Internal</h4>
      <p>
        Developed a comprehensive revenue forecasting platform utilizing <strong>Angular 18</strong> for the frontend and <strong>ASP.NET Core Web API</strong> for the backend. The application follows a <strong>monolithic architecture</strong> and implements robust <strong>JWT authentication</strong> for secure access.<br />
        I configured CI/CD pipelines using <strong>Azure DevOps</strong> to automate deployments, and hosted the app on <strong>Azure App Services</strong>. The system leverages <strong>Azure SQL</strong> for efficient data storage and implements a <strong>Data First</strong> approach with Entity Framework.<br />
        Key features include data filtration based on project and year, and revenue forecasts derived from statistical modeling and probability analysis.
